Open Source remake of an old mobile classic, 0xTowerGame!

## Installing the SDK

In the case you would like to use the bleeding edge version of the SDK, you can clone the Cere Games SDK repo from Github and install using NPM.

```
$> git clone https://github.com/cere-io/cere-games-sdk.git
$> npm install --save
```

Alternatively, you can save & install the latest [@cere/games-sdk package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cere/games-sdk) NPM package directly.

```
$> npm install --save @cere/games-sdk
```
